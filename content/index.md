### Commissions
I'm not currently open for commissions. Thank you for your understanding!

### Updates
I regularly update my plugins to support new versions, add new features and to fix bugs. When I do so, I will issue an announcement in the [HuskHelp Discord](https://discord.gg/tVYhJfyDWG).

If you would like to receive notifications when I post an announcement and/or gain access to preview builds, you can use the buttons in the `#role-picker` channel to opt-in to notifications

### Other projects
I'm a member of the [Haroohie Translation Club](https://haroohie.club/), a fan-translation group working on translating games from the Haruhi Suzumiya series!
